ircbot written in C
===================

circle apparently stands for C IRC Library/Executable (which arguably is a bit
of a stretch...)

There are several distinct components:

- libcircle (C library for connecting to IRC)
- circle (executable that uses the library)
- modules (dynamic libraries that extend the functionality of circle)
