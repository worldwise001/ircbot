To compile:
	gcc -Wall -rdynamic -lpthread -ldl *.c -oircbotd

Alternatively, run make:
        make

Any modules must be placed in the "./module" subdirectory.
Default configuration file is ./ircbotd.conf; a custom one may be set
through flags:

ircbotd -c conffile

To make custom modules:

- Include at least ircbotd.h
- Implement the following prototype, or else the module will not be loaded:
		void parse(const irccfg_t * config, const msg_t * data);
	Take a look at datatype.h to see what is in the custom data types.
- Please use the following prototype for writing output to the stream:
		void respond(irccfg_t * config, char * format, ... );
	this allows for proper signaling to the parent thread to send/flush the stream;
	format is the string format, similar to the printf family of functions
- To compile:
	gcc -Wall -fPIC -shared *.c -o libcustommod.so
- Placing this in the "./modules" directory on ircbotd startup will cause it to be automatically
	loaded; placed anywhere else, you can still load it while ircbotd is running by sending
		!load libcustommod.so
	for example.

Note: be warned that creating your own modules increases the risk that your bot	may segfault.
